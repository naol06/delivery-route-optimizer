# delivery-route-optimizer
 C++ program that optimizes delivery routes using the Divide and Conquer approach. The program implements a Closest Pair of Points algorithm, which is often used in logistics to minimize travel distance.


This project aims to optimize delivery routes for logistics using divide and conquer algorithms.

## Algorithms Used:
1. **Brute Force**: Calculates the minimum distance by evaluating all possible routes.
2. **Closest Pair**: Implements the closest pair problem as part of a divide and conquer strategy.
3. **Divide and Conquer**: Divides the problem into subproblems and merges the solutions to optimize routes.
